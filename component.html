<h1>Component Analysis of S&P 500 Companies</h1>
<p>The index is market-capitalization-weighted, meaning companies with larger market values have greater influence on its performance. 
    Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying a company's share price by its total outstanding shares. The S&P 500 covers about 80% of the total U.S. stock market value.</p>
